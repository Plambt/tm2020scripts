This file contains notes and maybe informative bits about how gamemodes work in Trackmania 2020 (as of (04.07.2020), right after release).

### maptype:
The standard maptype as of now is `TrackMania\\TM_Race`, note the backslash!

### #RequireContext
`#RequireContext CSmMode` context for gamemodes to make them work

### C_DefaultHudModulePath
Somehow throws an error as a default HUD module path seems to not exist yet, to be checked further
