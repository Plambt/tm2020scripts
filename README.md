# tm2020scripts
Repository for development of gamemode maptype and other scripts for Trackmania (2020)

## usage
The scripts simply have to be dropped into the local TrackMania directory at .../Documents/TrackMania2020/Scripts/ and then they are as ready to use as they currently are.

## contribution
If you'd like to contribute to the scripts, simply fork, do changes, send a pull request! Any help is greatly welcomed.

## issues
You encounter a problem using the scripts? You have an idea what could be better? File an issue here on Github. If the script has crashed an the game has shown you an error message, please include the error message including the log it might show to the issue. If applicable, also explain what you did that before the script did something wrong :)
