# Trackmania (2020) scripts

In this repository there will be all kinds of scripts for Trackmania (2020) as they are being developed. The folder structure is equivalent to the folder structer you should have under `Documents/Trackmania2020/Scripts/`, so you can clone the repo and put the contents to there.

## Usage
Clone the repo to `Documents/Trackmania2020/Scripts/` or download the individual files and put them into their folders if you only want some scripts.

## Contribution & Issues
If you have any suggestions, please file an issue here on Github outlining the suggestions or even file a pull-request if you already implemented them. Any help on writing these scripts is greatly appreciated!

If you encounter any bugs or problems, please file an issue here on Github! If possible, please include any error messages Trackmania gives you and tell how to reproduce the problem.
